// TAB KEY TEMPLATES
I want to implement customizable tab key templates.
 * Tab key action should be customizable.  By default, it should inject the 0x09 (\t) character.  But it should be able to inject spaces as well
 * If "spaces" are selected instead of "Tab Character", the number of spaces inserted by a tab keypress should be calculated to match "where are we right now?" to "where would the next issue of tab put us?
 * By default, space tabbing should be locked at 4, with every tab keypress aligned to the next 4 spaces.  For example, pressing tab 3 times on a new line should put the cursor on position 12; typing five characters and pressing tab two times should put the cursor on position 12..
 * A "tab template" allows the user to specify how many spaces get injected each time tab is pressed.
 * 4,8,4 would inject up to four spaces until the cursor is at position 4, up to 8 spaces until the cursor is at position 12, up to 4 spaces until at position 16, and after that, pressing tab uses the default spacing
 * a dot "." should represent "the standard number of spaces", so `.,.,8,.`:
    * with default tab spaces set to 2 should equal `2, 2, 8, 2` and
    * with default tab spaces set to 4 should equal `4, 4, 8, 4`

Tab key templates should be saved by a user-provided name (such as JCL or Cobol) and an editor should be available to allow editing the template after it's been saved.

> When no tab key template is in use, the status bar should state "Tab" or "Spaces (n)"
> When a tab key template is in use, the status bar should simply refer to the template name, such as "JCL".
> Clicking the tab key template from the status bar should give a menu that lets the user pick tabs, spaces, or a custom template name.
> The number of spaces should be configurable from a file menu option, not from the picker




// New document title bar should be the first line of text (up to 16 characters, otherwise 13 characters + `...`)






// tab / shift tab on selected block performs indentation


// Wrapping and LRECL seem to work, with one bug:
// When LRECL wraps the line, the last character on the line before a wrap is inaccessible.
// Clicking puts the cursor between the second-last and last character.  Right arrow moves to the next line.  That last character is inaccessible.


// Open now has "Open in this window" and "Open in new window" options

// In File Menu, "New" now has a slide-out option "Reopen in new window" that creates a new window, tied to the same parent file (if we're attached to a file).  If file edits are present, additional options are: "keep modifications" or "from original file"


// BUG LIST
 * "Show special characters" work was partially completed.  Still broken:
    * Special characters should be middle aligned in their field
    * New line character does not display correctly for end of file
    * Something else, but I forget what.
    * Toggling special characters should not reset viewport to position 1,1

 * Opening a large file (such as a 32MB log file) locks up on load for a very long time.  Notepad, on the other hand, opens the same file almost immediately.

 * Replace All breaks the undo stack.  Before a replace all, undo is unlimited.  After a replace all, undo is reset.  Future edits after the replace all should all be avaialble to back out, but nothing prior to the replace all can be backed out.

 * The Windows scaling bug when a 4K monitor is present and scaling is set >100%!  Ugh!  The UI is almost unreadable in that scenario.

 * If accidentally hovering the Line Number gutter when selecting text, all text from the end of the selected range to line 1 character 1 is selected.  Very disruptive if attempting to select multiple lines of text embedded deep in a large document.

 * Despite repeated callouts to correct, searching past the end of the document using F3 / Shift + F3 still does not notify in the task bar!

 * Attempting to open a .pdf resulted in an error.  While I (the human) do not expect to be able to read the contents of non-text files as such, I expect to have their contents loaded and displayed as Notepad would do, as encoded representations of the binary data inside.

 * On ALL dialogues that ask about dropping unsaved changes, Y, N, or ESC should map to "Yes", "No", and "Cancel" respectively.
 
 * Arrow keys should move between the buttons.

 * Closing a document with unsaved changes should prompt, not just disappear.

 * Replace button should instantly replace the next instance.  Replace All does not work.
 
 * When tabbing between fields in the Replace dialog, the new field should enter focus with the text selected





// TOUGH TASKS


// Connect to dev tools to read std out?
// Not immediately feasible, but can be done with an IDE-specific extension.  Copilot notes:
// IMPLEMENTATION: Build a companion VS Code extension + SwingNote console listener.
// Extension (TypeScript, ~250 lines): Listens to Debug Adapter Protocol events, captures debug console output, forwards via TCP socket to SwingNote.
// SwingNote (Java, ~350 lines): Adds console panel, listens on socket, displays incoming output in real-time.
// Fully decoupled: no changes needed to user's debug setup or monitored application. Extension auto-connects when debugging starts.
// Build sequence: (1) Architecture diagram, (2) VS Code extension with DAP listener, (3) SwingNote socket listener + console panel UI.
// Socket protocol: line-based messages formatted as "TYPE:MESSAGE" where TYPE is stdout or stderr.
