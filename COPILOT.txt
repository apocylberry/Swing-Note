• Despite repeated callouts to correct, searching for basic text such as `ipsum` will sometimes highlight the matched text (expected), and will sometimes highlight text following the match (unexpected)

• "Show special characters" does not show the new line, tab, and space characters

• Disabling line numbers should remove the line number bar on the left margin

• Line numbers still do not scroll with text when word wrap is enabled

• Despite multiple dives in to fix, the project icon.svg still does not show anywhere.  The application still uses the basic Java icon.

• Despite repeated callouts to correct, searching past the end of the document using F3 / Shift + F3 still does not notify in the task bar!

• Attempting to open a .pdf resulted in an error.  While I (the human) do not expect to be able to read the contents of non-text files as such, I expect to have their contents loaded and displayed as Notepad would do, as encoded representations of the binary data inside.
