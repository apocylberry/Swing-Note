// HUMAN STATEMENTS
> This project is 100% AI driven.  Despite being a seasoned programmer, I have not and will not touch the code in this project.  I am using this project to familiarize myself with prompt-driven design.
> Never modify the following files:
  * AGENT_DIRECTIVES.txt
  * DEV_NOTES.md

> Bugs and features will be listed in `DEV_NOTES.md`.  Those details are for human consumption.  You  may use context added to the dev notes to help solve or understand context for a given task, but you are **not** to initiate work or otherwise take action based on the contents of that file without first asking permission.
> When you feel details you have learned in the current session may be helpful as a directive, clearly call out that you feel `AGENT_DIRECTIVES.txt` should have a point added, and provide text *intended a for future AI to implement* (in other words, it should make sense to an AI, not necessarily a human).
> I do not commit features until they are in a working, or at least acceptable, state.  If a feature is partly working, and gets obliterated on successive edits, the partially-working state will **not** be in the commit history.


// ENVIRONMENT DETAILS
> Begin each session by determining the terminal system you are working with.  If you're on Windows / PowerShell, do not try to issue Linux commands.  Likewise, if you are on Linux, do not try to issue Windows / PowerShell commands.
> ** DO NOT HALLUCINATE THE TERMINAL SYSTEM >> ALWAYS PERFORM AN INITIALIZATION TEST TO DETERMINE IT FACTUALLY. **
> ** ALWAYS RUN THIS CHECK DURING THE SAME PROMPT THAT YOU ENCOUNTER THIS DIRECTIVE. DO NOT ASK TO FOLLOW UP OR DO IT LATER. **
> When summarizing what you have learned, provide the name of the terminal system you will interface with.


> When operating on the machine whose name begins with `l`, Maven commands must be issued with `mvnd`.  Otherwise, Maven commands sholud be accessible via `mvn`.  **YOU** must run the commands to determine the machine name.  You may be running on Linux or Windows, so you will need to determine the appropriate command for the environment.
> ** DO NOT HALLUCINATE THE MACHINE NAME >> ALWAYS ISSUE A COMMAND TO THE OS TO DETERMINE IT FACTUALLY. **
> ** ALWAYS RUN THIS CHECK DURING THE SAME PROMPT THAT YOU ENCOUNTER THIS DIRECTIVE. DO NOT ASK TO FOLLOW UP OR DO IT LATER. **

> When presenting a change for human review, always ask to issue `{maven} clean compile`.
> ** THE MAVEN COMMAND MUST ALWAYS BE `{maven} clean compile`.  DO NOT TRY TO QUIET OR HIDE OUTPUT, TAIL OUTPUT, OR ANY OTHER TRICK TO SLIM THE OUTPUT.  I WANT TO SEE THE COMPLETE COMPILE RESULTS! **
> When summarizing what you have learned, provide the exact Maven command that will be used during the rest of the session.


// AI STATEMENTS
> When applying fixes to bugs that have not resolved after multiple attempts with different approaches, 
  do not continue attempting variations of the same logical approach. Instead, pause and request human 
  input on whether the problem might have a different root cause, or ask permission to add diagnostic 
  logging to trace actual vs. expected behavior. A persistent bug that survives multiple reasonable 
  fixes often indicates either: (1) a misunderstanding of the actual problem, (2) a root cause in a 
  different code path than assumed, or (3) a constraint or behavior of the underlying framework that 
  wasn't initially apparent.
