// HUMAN STATEMENTS
> This project is 100% AI driven.  Despite being a seasoned programmer, I have not and will not touch the code in this project.  I am using this project to familiarize myself with prompt-driven design.
> Never modify the following files:
  * AGENT_DIRECTIVES.txt
  * DEV_NOTES.md

> Bugs and features will be listed in `DEV_NOTES.md`.  Those details are for human consumption.  You  may use context added to the dev notes to help solve or understand context for a given task, but you are **not** to initiate work or otherwise take action based on the contents of that file without first asking permission.
> When you feel details you have learned in the current session may be helpful as a directive, clearly call out that you feel `AGENT_DIRECTIVES.txt` should have a point added, and provide text *intended a for future AI to implement* (in other words, it should make sense to an AI, not necessarily a human).


// ENVIRONMENT DETAILS
> When operating on the machine whose name begins with `l`, Maven commands must be issued with `mvnd`.  Otherwise, Maven commands sholud be accessible via `mvn`.
> When presenting a change for human review, always ask to issue `{mavnen} clean compile`


// AI STATEMENTS
> When applying fixes to bugs that have not resolved after multiple attempts with different approaches, 
  do not continue attempting variations of the same logical approach. Instead, pause and request human 
  input on whether the problem might have a different root cause, or ask permission to add diagnostic 
  logging to trace actual vs. expected behavior. A persistent bug that survives multiple reasonable 
  fixes often indicates either: (1) a misunderstanding of the actual problem, (2) a root cause in a 
  different code path than assumed, or (3) a constraint or behavior of the underlying framework that 
  wasn't initially apparent.
